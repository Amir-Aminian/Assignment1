        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I have studied Petroleum Engineering but worked as a Technical Office Expert in a construction company. I had to be able to work with different types of software to get hired there. Fortunately, as I have always had a passion for technology, I was able to self-taught myself. That was then I realized how much I like computer field studies, So I followed my curiosity and succeeded above my expectations.Now I want to pursue what I like that is why I chose to participate in Get Coding program.</p>
